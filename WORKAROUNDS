These are a bunch of workarounds for problems epii encountered when trying to
deploy.  They're listed here so he doesn't have to keep rediscovering them
every 3 months.


You probably want to consider installing floof within a python virtualenv to
keep floof's Python environment separate from the rest of your system.  If you
do so and hit "SSLv2_method" errors with M2Crypto later on in the install
process (typically on Debian-derived distros), try installing your
distribution's python-m2crypto package and then running (adjusting for local
version numbers and system library locations):

    rm -r env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/M2Crypto-0.21.1-py2.7-linux-i686.egg/M2Crypto
    ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/M2Crypto env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/M2Crypto-0.21.1-py2.7-linux-i686.egg/M2Crypto

(This is a horribly hacky solution, and I dearly hope someone has a better one.)


You may also run into errors with PIL and errors like "python decoder zip not
available".  Make sure that you have the zlib, libjpeg and libfreetype
development packages installed on your system and that lib{freetype,jpeg,z}.so
are all available in /usr/lib (if necessary, run find over /usr/lib and symlink
them from their subdir hidey-holes up to /usr/lib) then run:

    pip uninstall PIL
    pip install PIL

Check the installation-time compilation output: you should see a section to
the effect of:

    *** TKINTER support not available
    --- JPEG support available
    --- ZLIB (PNG/ZIP) support available
    --- FREETYPE2 support available
    *** LITTLECMS support not available

At least JPEG and ZLIB really need to be available.
