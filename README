# Installation

Use the setuptools setup script:

    python setup.py install

If you're a developer, you probably want `develop` instead of `install`, and
you may wish to consider using virtualenv to keep floof's Python environment
separate from the rest of your system.

Create a configuration file:

    cp paster.ini config.ini

You may call this file whatever you want, for example `development.ini` or
`production.ini`.

Configure as appropriate, then run the setup to populate the database:

    paster setup-app config.ini

## File storage

You have two options for storing files, controlled by the `filestore` setting:

* **local** stores files in the filesystem normally.

    The `filestore.directory` setting specifies the root of the storage.  This
    directory must already exist and be writable by the Python process.

* **mogilefs** stores files in the MogileFS distributed filesystem.  You'll
    need the `pymogile` package installed, available from
    https://github.com/AloneRoad/pymogile in the 2.0 branch.

    `filestore.trackers` is a space-delimited list of trackers.

    `filestore.domain` is the name of the MogileFS domain under which all the
    files will be stored.

    See the mogile docs for creating a basic mogile environment:
    http://code.google.com/p/mogilefs/wiki/InstallHowTo

For development, invoke the application with:

    bin/dev-server.sh config.ini
