floof
=====

floof_ is a communal art gallery Web site.  It's powered by Python_ and runs
atop the Pyramid_ web framework.

``floof`` is free and open source software released under the `ISC license`_
(functionally equivalent to the two-clause BSD license).

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _Pyramid: http://www.pylonsproject.org/
.. _ISC license: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license

To avoid duplication of effort while ``floof`` remains in heavy development
and in a state of high interface churn, only the Developer documentation is
currently being written.

While it is possible that other documentation will be rolled into ``floof``
itself and thus never appear in this document; for now the Developer
documentation is modelled as a subsection.
