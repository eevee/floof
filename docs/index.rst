floof
=====

floof_ is a communal art gallery Web site.  It's powered by Python_ and runs
atop the Pyramid_ web framework.

``floof`` refers to both the floof art gallery site and the software package
that underpins it.  This documentation relates to the software package, which
is free and open source software released under the `ISC license`_
(functionally equivalent to the two-clause BSD license).

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _Pyramid: http://www.pylonsproject.org/
.. _ISC license: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license

To avoid duplication of effort while ``floof`` remains in heavy development
and in a state of high interface churn, only the Developer documentation is
currently being written.

It is possible that other documentation will be rolled into ``floof`` itself
and thus never appear in this document; for now the Developer documentation is
modelled as a subsection.
