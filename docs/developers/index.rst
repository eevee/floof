Developer Documentation
=======================

This documentation aims to be an aide to developers who wish to hack on
``floof``.  As much as possible, the documentation is automatically generated
from docstrings, although it includes some additional high-level overviews of
modules and architecture as well as explainations for design decisions where
appropriate.
